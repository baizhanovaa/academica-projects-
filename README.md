# projects 

- Statistics.py: Descriptive Statistics
This Python script, Statistics.py, provides descriptive statistics for a given dataset. It includes calculations for mean, median, mode, range (max - min), standard deviation, percentile, histogram, boxplot, and interquartile range.

- Statistics2.py: Advanced Descriptive Statistics
The Statistics2.py script builds upon basic statistics and extends functionality. It computes the mean, median, mode, range, standard deviation, percentile, histogram, boxplot, and interquartile range for a dataset. This script is an enhanced version of Statistics.py with additional features.

- coffee_sales_data.py: Coffee Sales Analysis
The coffee_sales_data.py script focuses on the analysis of coffee sales data. It includes functionalities to visualize the distribution of sales using a bar plot, boxplot, and histogram. This script is designed to provide insights into the patterns and trends of coffee sales.

- mini project.py: US Flights Analysis with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
The mini project.py script utilizes Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to analyze flight data in the United States. It covers basic statistics and includes the creation of histograms to visualize the distribution of relevant data. This script offers a comprehensive overview of flight-related statistics with informative visualizations.

- qqplot and kde.py: QQ Plot and Kernel Density Estimation
Implements Quantile-Quantile plots (qqplot) and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). QQ plots help assess data normality, while KDE provides a smooth estimate of the probability density function.

- ML_project_final: This project employs an array of machine learning algorithms and data manipulation tools to predict customer transaction amounts. The primary dataset, train_dataset.csv, consists of transaction sums under the column int_target, which serves as the target variable.
Key Tools and Libraries Used:
Data Handling: pandas for data manipulation, numpy for numerical operations.
Visualization: matplotlib and plotly for graphical representations of data insights.
Machine Learning Models: Utilization of ensemble methods from sklearn.ensemble (Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting), boosting models like xgboost.XGBClassifier and lightgbm.LGBMClassifier, as well as catboost.CatBoostClassifier. Traditional algorithms include sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression and LinearRegression.
Model Evaluation and Optimization: Metrics from sklearn.metrics (confusion matrix, R2 score, etc.), and GridSearchCV for model tuning.
Preprocessing: sklearn.preprocessing for feature scaling and encoding, and dimensionality reduction with PCA.

- MINI PROJECT ML (fv) hw .ipynb: This project focuses on building and optimizing machine learning models to solve a predictive task.
Key Tools and Libraries Used:
Data Handling and Analysis: pandas for dataset manipulation, numpy for numerical computations.
Machine Learning Pipeline:
Preprocessing: MinMaxScaler from sklearn.preprocessing for feature scaling.
Model Selection and Validation: train_test_split and GridSearchCV from sklearn.model_selection for splitting data and optimizing model parameters.
Visualization: matplotlib for generating plots to visualize data and results.
Performance Metrics: mean_squared_error (MSE) and r2_score from sklearn.metrics for evaluating model accuracy and performance.
